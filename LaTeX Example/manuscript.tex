\title{Sorting Network \LaTeX\ Test}

  \maketitle
	
	\noindent
	Sorting networks exported in \TeX\ format
	from the \verb'WinVerifyAndDraw' tool
	in Parberry~\cite{Parberry2022SNS}
	contain a \verb'picture' environment
	that can be directly input to your \LaTeX\ file using the \verb"\input"
	command.
  For example, suppose you have exported a sorting network
	to file \verb"exported.tex". Use the following to incorporate this file
	as a figure in your \LaTeX\ document. 
	
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{figure}
    \centering\input{exported.tex}
  \end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
	
	\noindent
	The remainder of this document will show you how it looks using
	the exported files
	\verb"knuth16h.tex" (exported in \verb'Horizontal' draw mode)
	in Figure~\ref{fig-h} and
	\verb"knuth16v.tex" (exported in \verb'Vertical' draw mode) in Figure~\ref{fig-v}.
	
	Knuth~\cite{knuth1997art} depicts sorting networks with the channels
	drawn horizontally and the comparators drawn vertically (see,
	for example, Figure~\ref{fig-h}). Each comparator
	directs the minimum of its two inputs to the upper channel and the 
	maximum to the lower channel. The inputs are presented at the left
	and the outputs appear at the right in non-decreasing order from top to bottom.

	\end{figure}
	
	Parberry~\cite{parberry1990single, parberry1991computational, parberry1992pairwise}
	depicts sorting networks with the channels
	drawn vertically and the comparators drawn horizontally (see,
	for example, Figure~\ref{fig-v}). Each comparator
	directs the minimum of its two inputs to the left channel and the 
	maximum to the right channel. The inputs are presented at the top
	and the outputs appear at the bottom in non-decreasing order from left to right.
